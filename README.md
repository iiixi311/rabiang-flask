# Rabiang

Rabiang(ระเบียง) is a Thai word which means wooden terrace.

I always dream of developing software with a cup of coffee sitting on the terrace.

I am not good at web design, so I had to adopt themes from [startbootstrap.com](http://startbootstrap.com/) based on Bootstrap 3.

Feel free to email me if you want to contribute your HTML/css files.

This application is currently being developed so that the following features are supported.

I am planning on initial release in September or October 2016.
